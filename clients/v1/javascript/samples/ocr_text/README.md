# Sample - Extract text using OCR and JavaScript

The sample provided in this section uses the [*Muhimbi PDF Converter Services Online*](https://github.com/Muhimbi/PDF-Converter-Services-Online) to recognise text in image based files (scans, faxes, etc) using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The OCRed content is returned as a text string.

Additional sample code to *convert, merge, watermark, secure* and *OCR* files [can be found here](../).
